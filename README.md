# This is a simple program that can accept a CSV file and output an array of people, splitting the name into
# the correct fields, and splitting multiple people from one string where appropriate.

# We have a Model Class that holds the Person's data

# We have a CSV Parser class thats parses the csv file

# We have a NameParser class that parses each line of data from the csv file
